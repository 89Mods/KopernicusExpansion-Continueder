PLANS:
------
- TEMPORARY DEPRECATION: Extra PQSMods are not the focus of this mod at the moment. The current focus is making planets look "sharp af" as the kids say. I WILL be adding them back after fixing everything else
- Considering other deprecations, looking in to functions of technical features
- Implement Jool Shaders as gas giant replacement
- Wiki for modders
- Try and get Kopernicus on board with a link so modders know these features exist
